"Mean Dwell Time" is often a metric used by Security Operations Center (SOC) managers to measure the capability of their team to triage incidents.
 - [Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)) - social and psychological manipulation with the intent of getting a victim to divulge secrets. Often used in cyberattacks.
